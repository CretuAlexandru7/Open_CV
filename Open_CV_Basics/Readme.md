<h1 align="center">Image Processing Operations with OpenCV</h1>

<p align="center">
  This repository contains a program that demonstrates fundamental image processing operations using the OpenCV library. The program reads frames from a webcam and applies various techniques to manipulate the images in real-time. The following operations are implemented:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Color inversion: Inverts the colors of each frame.</li>
  <li>Image thresholding: Converts the frame into a binary image based on a specified threshold.</li>
  <li>Image mirroring: Mirrors the frame horizontally.</li>
  <li>Flipping the image: Flips the frame vertically.</li>
  <li>Converting image to a grayscale schema</li>
  <li>Motion: calculate the absolute difference between two framse</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>OpenCV library (version X.X.X)</li>
</ul>
